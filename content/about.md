I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student with a genuine passion for computers and understanding how they work. I started this blog to learn in public and improve my communication skills. I'm particularly fascinated by distributed systems and platform engineering, and I look forward to exploring these interests further and work in these areas in the (hopefully, near) future.
